Unfortunately i have not figured out a way of publishing/hosting the game online so if anyone finds this and wants to git it a go i will leave the steps to do it below.

- Download all the files in a folder or clone repo in your pc
- Use VSCode to open the folder
- Open the terminal and run npm i
- After that run npm run dev
- Inside terminal there will be a local host ip click on it or copy paste the link in browser and enjoy
- Game is still developing and i'm not sure what i'm doing so lower your expectations:)
